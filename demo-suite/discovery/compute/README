This directory is for storing local copies of discovery documents, which
speeds up performance. The small gain in performance does not seem like
it would compensate for the problem of a static API, which cannot adapt
to changes, so this feature has been disabled in lib/google_cloud/gce.py,
however, this directory (and it's previous contents) remain intact in case
we decide to reuse local discovery docs in the future.
